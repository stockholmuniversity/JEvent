Description:  An eventdriven framework for XMPP PubSub
 JEvent is a wrapper class around Net::XMPP which also implements parts of
 PubSub (JEP0060). The purpouse of JEvent is to create a framework for building
 agents capable of publishing and consuming events. JEvent also supports a
 simple mechanism of management by sending text-commands to the agent. Typically
 an agent is implemented as a perl-script which creates a JEvent object and 
 calls the Run method.
 .
 Method calls are authorized using calls to a SPOCP server. This behaviour can
 be overridden by providing the CommandAuthorization argument to the JEvent
 constructor.
